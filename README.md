# Converting the files in .ipynb format to other formats:

Inside this repository there are several files in .ipynb format, which consists of the codes to postprocess the data obtained during DFT and phase field simulations.

To convert these files into other formats the following command could be utilized in the terminal of an Ubuntu computer:

$  jupyter nbconvert --to file_of_desired_format filename.ipynb

where,
file_of_desired_format can be in .html, .py, .pdf or .tex format.

For .html, file_of_desired_format = html

For .py, file_of_desired_format = script

For .pdf, file_of_desired_format = pdf

For .tex, file_of_desired_format = latex

E.g. to convert to file in .py format, the following command is issued:

$  jupyter nbconvert --to script filename.ipynb
